3. Running the App

- Download Pre-built Releases (Optional):

If you prefer not to build the app from source, you can download pre-built release versions for your Android device (coming soon):

4. Using the App

- Permission Request:

The app will request permission to access your device's storage when you launch it for the first time. Grant this permission to allow the app to save statuses in the gallery.
Viewing Statuses:

Open WhatsApp and browse statuses as usual. The app doesn't access WhatsApp directly.

Saving Statuses:

When you see a status you want to save, navigate back to the Status Saver app. Statuses from contacts you've recently viewed in WhatsApp should appear within the app.

Saving Confirmation:

Tap on the desired status to save it. You'll receive a confirmation message once the status is successfully saved to your gallery.

## Disclaimer

This application respects WhatsApp's privacy policies and does not access their internal data or messages.
It's recommended to use this app only for statuses that your contacts have explicitly shared with you.
